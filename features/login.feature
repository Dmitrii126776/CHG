Feature: Swag Labs Login

  As a Swag Labs customer who is not locked out,
  I need to be able to log in so
  that I can purchase Sauce Labs merch.

  Background:
    Given I am on the Sauce Demo Login Page

  Scenario: Successful Login
    When I fill the account information for account StandardUser into the Username field and the Password field
    And I click the Login Button
    Then I am redirected to the Sauce Demo Main Page
    And I verify the App Logo exists

  Scenario: Failed Login
    When I fill the account information for account LockedOutUser into the Username field and the Password field
    And I click the Login Button
    Then I verify the Error Message contains the text `Sorry, this user has been banned.`
